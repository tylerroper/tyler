        <p class="text">Having a place such as trello to keep all the information you come up with<br>
            and to keep track of things that need doing and that have been done.<br>
            Theres even a trello for this webpage: <a href="https://trello.com/b/GrnnUlOP/my-website">Trello</a>. </p>
        <b>Planning:</b></br>

            finding out what work we need doing to make the plan work</br>
            this involves good team communication and creativity.</p>
        <b>Development:</b></br>
        <p class="text">This is the stage at which the project develops from</br>
            back-end to front-end, securing the project's foundation</br>

        <h3>Resources:</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <li>Trello - This is an online tool that enables a team scope and plan a project.<br>
                It allows for organizing tasks into Things To Be Done, Doing and Done which in<br>
                turn allows for easy workflow from start to completion.</li><br>
            <li>Keynote - This is presentation software that helps us inform and explain to others
                what we did and how we did it using a slideshow presentations.</li><br>
            <li>VS Code - This is a free and open source code editor that is used for<br>
                compiling and debugging modern applications.</li><br>
            <li>Slack - This allows us to communicate better as a team and share any<br>
                information/work with each other. Linking slack to Trello showed the team<br>
                in slack if anybody updated the Trello board so everybody was kept up-to-date<br>
                with any changes. </li><br>
            <li>Xcode - This is a free piece of software that you can create <br>
                and test apps on, its very straight forward and easy to use </li>

        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <li>Rolling out an app initially with all the necessary functionalities is way better<br>
                than releasing an app with features and innovations that end-users might not be open to.<br>
                It is safe to release an app initially, collect and collate feedback and then update as<br>
                clients and end-users dictate</li><br>
            <li>Having the right amount of highly engaging people working on a project is way better than<br>
                having a lot of people as this leads to chaos and little decision making. Also,<br>
                it is important to have a main slack that everybody else can report<br>
                to because it is better when instructions are coming from a sole source</li><br>
            <li>A good user interface is a must-have for an application. Users most likely engage<br>
                with the apps that are user-friendly and have good user-experience.<br>
                A good interface helps the user to navigate easily through your website.</li><br>
            <li>You need good security because everyday hackers are learning new ways to<br>
                get in and out of our systems meaning we have to keep all our security software<br>
                upto date and active with good, trustworthy anti-virus software</li>

        <h3>Legal guidelines and constraints </h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>In order for the app to function in the real world, it has got to go through a series<br>
                of compliance tests. Compliance to laws and regulations, privacy terms, financial and<br>
                technological cooperation as well as secure storage of client information. The impact of<br>
                GDPR on digital projects is urging us as developers to seek permission from client before<br>
                accepting their data and to make sure we are completely compliant about what we want to do<br>
                with it, how we choose to store and access it.</p><br><br>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>The tools available to me seen under the resources section, are capable of successfully creating a good
                project and heres why:</p>
            <li><b>Trello</b> was good for organizing my objectives during the scoping and planning phases of the
                website.</li><br>
            <li><B>VS Code</B> was the main software of my choice during the development phase of my project, writing
                and compiling code.<br>
                The only problem that I encountered with VS Code during the course of the project was the fact that
                I<br>
                had to constantly and consistently revert from web browser to software package and vice versa in order
                to know
                what my website looked like but that was quickly fixed with the "HTTP Server / HTML Preview" extension.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Slack</b> was great for keeping in touch with my group and my tutors which is essential for any
                project where you need good communication with other people</li><br>

            <p><b>Strengths and weaknesses</b></p>
            <li>A strength is that its really simple and easy to navigate with well structured points and paragraphs
            </li><br>
            <li>A weakness is that its abit boring and bland</li>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
    <br>
    <div class="box">
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>If i had more time id split the different headers into theyre own pages and id add<br>
                a dropdown menu to navigate with, also id make it look alot cleaner and more professional.<br>
                Id also like to add a main home page where instead of haveing to go into the dropdown menu<br>
                you could just click links.</p>
            <p>i wish i had created my own slack board to use for planning and structuring when creating my site<br>
                it would have helped me be alot more productive and efficient with the prioritisation of my tasks.</p>
