        <h3>Why i joined CODE NATION:</h3>
        <P>I joined because ive always been fascinated with technology</br>
            and wondered how it worked but i didnt know where to go so </br>
            with some help from a support group i got pointed in this direction</br>
            which was exactly what i was looking for.</P>
        <h3>The purpose of IT in modern business:</h3>
        <p>IT is one of the most important things in modern business</br>
            from multi-national corporations to small single computer</br>
            businesses it manages everything from marketing strategies to</br>
            company websites.</p>
        <p>IT also helps a business understand its cash flow needs and</br>
            preserve resources such as time and physical space.</p>
        <p>IT increases globalism. With the use of IT a business<br>
            can reach a range of consumers and demographics all around the world without<br>
            needing to physically enter the countries.</p>
        <p>IT also affects operations and can streamline processes with the use of machinery<br>
            for example Tesco now often use machines to pack bags for online shopping and use<br>
            self check outs in stores.</p>
        
        <h3>Heres some of the key things i think goes into a successful project:</h3>
        <p>Having a place such as trello to keep all the information you come up with<br>
            and to keep track of things that need doing and that have been done.<br>
            Theres even a trello for this webpage: <a href="https://trello.com/b/GrnnUlOP/my-website">Trello</a>. </p>
        <p><b>Planning:</b></br>
            Planning is coming up with different concepts and coming to a conclusion</br>
            on what concept would be the most efficient and successful outcome of the project</br>
            involving creative thinking and good communication.</p>
        <p><b>Scoping:</b></br>
            scoping is the brainstorming phase of the operation</br>
            finding out what work we need doing to make the plan work</br>
            this involves good team communication and creativity.</p>
        <p><b>Development:</b></br>
            This is the stage at which the project develops from</br>
            back-end to front-end, securing the project's foundation</br>
            before giving it its appearance creating a very simple version of the project</br>
            making it easy to aquire and organize all the information going on the site.</p>    
        <p><b>Testing:</b></br>
            This is the testing phase that ensures final product is ready and working,</br>
            various uses-test are carried out to ensure that functions and specifications</br>
            are spot-on before product goes live.</p>
        <p><b>Maintenance:</b></br>
            After delivering product, it now goes into maintenance phase thats a continuous phase</br>
            that seeks to improve functionality, fix bugs, addresses stability issues and offers</br>
            support to end-users</p>
        <h3>Resources</h3>
        <li>Trello - This is an online tool that enables a team scope and plan a project.<br>
            It allows for organizing tasks into Things To Be Done, Doing and Done which in<br>
            turn allows for easy workflow from start to completion.</li><br>
        <li>Keynote - This is presentation software that helps us inform and explain to others
            what we did and how we did it using a slideshow presentations.</li><br>
        <li>VS Code - This is a free and open source code editor that is used for<br>
            compiling and debugging modern applications.</li><br>        
        <li>Slack - This allows us to communicate better as a team and share any<br>
            information/work with each other. Linking slack to Trello showed the team<br>
            in slack if anybody updated the Trello board so everybody was kept up-to-date<br>
            with any changes. </li><br>
        <li>Xcode - This is a free piece of software that you can create <br>
            and test apps on, its very straight forward and easy to use </li><br>
        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <li>Rolling out an app initially with all the necessary functionalities is way better<br>
            than releasing an app with features and innovations that end-users might not be open to.<br>
            It is safe to release an app initially, collect and collate feedback and then update as<br>
            clients and end-users dictate</li><br>
        <li>Having the right amount of highly engaging people working on a project is way better than<br>
            having a lot of people as this leads to chaos and little decision making. Also,<br>
            it is important to have a main slack that everybody else can report<br>
            to because it is better when instructions are coming from a sole source</li><br>
        <li>A good user interface is a must-have for an application. Users most likely engage<br>
            with the apps that are user-friendly and have good user-experience.<br>
            A good interface helps the user to navigate easily through your website.</li><br>
        <li>You need good security because everyday hackers are learning new ways to<br>
            get in and out of our systems meaning we have to keep all our security software<br> 
            upto date and active with good, trustworthy anti-virus software</li>
        <h3>Legal guidelines and constraints </h3>
        <li>In order for the app to function in the real world, it has got to go through a series<br>
             of compliance tests. Compliance to laws and regulations, privacy terms, financial and<br>
             technological cooperation as well as secure storage of client information. The impact of<br>
             GDPR on digital projects is urging us as developers to seek permission from client before<br>
             accepting their data and to make sure we are completely compliant about what we want to do<br>
             with it, how we choose to store and access it.</li>
