        <p class="text">IT is one of the most important things in modern business</br>
            from multi-national corporations to small single computer</br>
            businesses it manages everything from marketing strategies to</br>
            company websites.</p>

            this involves good team communication and creativity.</p>
        <b>Development:</b></br>
        <p class="text">This is the stage at which the project develops from</br>
            back-end to front-end, securing the project's foundation</br>
            before giving it its appearance creating a very simple version of the project</br>

        <h3>Resources:</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <li>Trello - This is an online tool that enables a team scope and plan a project.<br>
                It allows for organizing tasks into Things To Be Done, Doing and Done which in<br>
                turn allows for easy workflow from start to completion.</li><br>
            <li>Keynote - This is presentation software that helps us inform and explain to others
                what we did and how we did it using a slideshow presentations.</li><br>
            <li>VS Code - This is a free and open source code editor that is used for<br>
                compiling and debugging modern applications.</li><br>
            <li>Slack - This allows us to communicate better as a team and share any<br>
                information/work with each other. Linking slack to Trello showed the team<br>
                in slack if anybody updated the Trello board so everybody was kept up-to-date<br>
                with any changes. </li><br>
            <li>Xcode - This is a free piece of software that you can create <br>
                and test apps on, its very straight forward and easy to use </li>

        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <li>Rolling out an app initially with all the necessary functionalities is way better<br>
                than releasing an app with features and innovations that end-users might not be open to.<br>
                It is safe to release an app initially, collect and collate feedback and then update as<br>
                clients and end-users dictate</li><br>
            <li>Having the right amount of highly engaging people working on a project is way better than<br>
                having a lot of people as this leads to chaos and little decision making. Also,<br>
                it is important to have a main slack that everybody else can report<br>
                to because it is better when instructions are coming from a sole source</li><br>
            <li>A good user interface is a must-have for an application. Users most likely engage<br>
                with the apps that are user-friendly and have good user-experience.<br>
                A good interface helps the user to navigate easily through your website.</li><br>
            <li>You need good security because everyday hackers are learning new ways to<br>
                get in and out of our systems meaning we have to keep all our security software<br>
                upto date and active with good, trustworthy anti-virus software</li>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>Legal guidelines and constraints </h3>
        <div class="text">
            <li>In order for the app to function in the real world, it has got to go through a series<br>
                of compliance tests. Compliance to laws and regulations, privacy terms, financial and<br>
                technological cooperation as well as secure storage of client information. The impact of<br>
                GDPR on digital projects is urging us as developers to seek permission from client before<br>
                accepting their data and to make sure we are completely compliant about what we want to do<br>
                with it, how we choose to store and access it.</li>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>The tools available to me seen under the resources section, are capable of successfully creating a good
                project and heres why:</p>
            <li><b>Trello</b> was good for organizing my objectives during the scoping and planning phases of the
                website.</li><br>
            <li><B>VS Code</B> was the main software of my choice during the development phase of my project, writing
                and compiling code.<br>
                The only problem that I encountered with VS Code during the course of the project was the fact that I
                had to<br>
                constantly and consistently revert from web browser to software package and vice versa in order to know
                what<br>
                my website looked like but that was quickly fixed with the "HTTP Server / HTML Preview" extension.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Slack</b> was great for keeping in touch with my group and my tutors which is essential for any
                project where you need good communication with other people</li><br>
            <br>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Strengths and weaknesses</p>
                <li>A strength is that its really simple and easy to navigate with well structured points and paragraphs
                </li><br>
                <li>A weakness is that its abit boring and bland</li>
